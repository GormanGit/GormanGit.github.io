        <h3 class="content" >Hi, Iâ€™m Jon. My passion for coding stems from the sense of satisfaction of turning my
            ideas into reality. The fact that coding fuels both my creative side as well as my technical side is huge.
            Having studied engineering as a major I am no stranger to problem solving which is a skill I enjoy using daily.
            Within the next two years I plan on being established as a software engineer and being well on my way to
            launching my own startup/business. I look forward to working with people who are passionate about what they
            do and strive to put ideas into action. Whether its a project for class or a something personal I make
            it a point to sharpen my skills daily in order to reach my goals.<br/>
            <!--So please, click around and see what I have been up to.-->

            <br/>Want to work together? I would love to hear from you.</h3>
